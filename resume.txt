Healthcare Chat bot | May 2025
I developed a medical chatbot using LangChain for context handling, Pinecone for semantic search, and the 
Gemini API for powerful language model capabilities. Streamlit provides an interactive user interface. The 
chatbot understands natural medical queries, retrieves real-time information, and oﬀers responses based 
on veriﬁed medical knowledge.

Crop and fertilizers recommendation | May 2025
with Streamlit, uses Decision Tree algorithms on soil and environmental data to suggest the best crop and 
fertilizer for optimal yield and sustainability. It's powered by Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, 
demonstrating a great blend of data science and practical application.

Spam and not Spam detection |Apr 2025
This project aims to develop an intelligent spam detection system that classiﬁes text messages or emails 
as "Spam" or "Not Spam" using cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The system is 
built with BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for generating powerful 
contextual word embeddings, coupled with a custom deep learning model using TensorFlow's Functional 
API for classiﬁcation. The model is deployed with an intuitive and interactive Streamlit-based web UI.

Handwritten Digit Classiﬁcation with Multi-Layer Perceptron | Apr 2025
Developed a deep learning model to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. This project 
focused on implementing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network in Keras, demonstrating proﬁciency in 
fundamental neural network architectures.
